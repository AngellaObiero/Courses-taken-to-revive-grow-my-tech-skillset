# Courses-taken-to-grow-my-tech-skillset
I am on a journey of transitioning to cloud engineering and I'm taking courses to not only grow me in this regard but to also rekindle my software engineering skills. As such, I will also be taking some UX/UI and product management courses as these are areas I have experience &amp; interest in as well.
