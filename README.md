# Courses-taken-to-revive-grow-my-tech-skillset
I am on a journey of transitioning to software engineering(hopefully cloud engineering) and I'm taking courses to not only grow me in this regard but to also rekindle my software engineering skills as I had set this aside for some time. I will also be taking some UX/UI and product management courses as these are areas I have experience &amp; interest in as well.
